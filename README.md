# Timed Quiz

# Description
This project utilized DOM manipulation of the HTML with Javascript with some CSS styling properties that also interacted with both the HTML and JS. After pressing the 'Start' button, a timer starts and the end-user is presented with questions and four answer buttons. Once a button is pressed, the next question and set of answers is presented until all of the questions are cycled through.

Once the timer is up, the end-user is presented with a form that requests for their initials. Once the initials are entered and the user presses 'submit', the value gets stored in localStorage.

My struggles with this project that I will work on:
1) Interaction with the timer for when a question is answered incorrectly, time needs to be subtracted
2) The initials form needs to pop up for the user on both events of either the timer expiring or the questions are finished.
3) The View-HiScore button is non-functional at this time.
4) A function needs to be made that prompts whether or not the user selected the correct or incorrect answer.
